        <h3>Perfect for Bodybuilders!</h3>
        
        <p>This dish is absolutely <strong>delicious!</strong> I love to make it after a long and hard workout.</p>

        <p>The protein in this anabolic French toast recipe comes from a combination of egg beaters (or egg whites) as well as a small amount of Greek yogurt.  I know that adding Greek yogurt to the egg mixture sounds odd, but I promise you cannot taste it! It gives us a nice little protein boost here with no added flavor at all.</p>
