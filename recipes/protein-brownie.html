        <p>Well really, you had me at just “brownie” but protein is a nice bonus! These brownies are super easy to make and packed with healthy ingredients you can actually feel good about! I will not tell if you sneak one of these brownies for breakfast.</p>

        <p>This recipe can be made in one bowl and one pan! Yay for minimal clean-up. These brownies do not have any flour, so they are gluten-free + grain-free.  The added protein helps to curb the blood sugar spike you typically get when eating sweets like brownies. Sure, these brownies are loaded with healthy ingredients but no one will even know! They are still so rich and fudgy.</p>
